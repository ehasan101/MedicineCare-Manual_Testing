## What I have done in this Test?
I have created test cases both positive & negative tests designed to validate the correct behavior of the app and identify some potential issues based on some scenarios. Basically it's divided into three section in excel sheet (UI-UX, All input field and others mix). Test with both valid & invalid input then get 15 actual results according to the expected result. There were 5 tests got wrong and 1 was a warning. \
All images of the test cases are given below also share `excel sheet` which **[uploaded on GD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A9ONZcUJ54XECvGjsVn1-jiyKj4lPWvK/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=106028938157744319674&rtpof=true&sd=true).**
