## What I have done in this Test?
I have created test cases both positive and negative test based on more scenarios. Basically it's divided into three parts (UI-UX, All input field and others mix). Test with both valid & invalid input then get 15 actual results according to the expected result. There were 5 tests got wrong and 1 was a warning. \
All images of the test cases are given below also share `excel sheet` which **[uploaded on GD](#).**
