# Manual Testing on MedicineCare App
MedicineCare is a mobile application designed to help users manage their medication schedules. This testing project covers the core functionalities of the application, from user registration to setting medication reminders. The testing process involves creating comprehensive test cases, executing them manually, logging results, and tracing requirements to ensure full test coverage.
Write some test cases in standard format from the MedicineCare app including RTM in Excel Sheet.

## Test Artifacts
This project includes the following test documentation:
1. Test Cases: Detailed test cases covering various modules of the application.
    - Design_Fault: Test cases focused on UI/UX and design-related issues.
    - All_Input_Field: Test cases for validating all user input fields.
    - Others_TC: General and miscellaneous functional test cases.

2. Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM):
    - RTM: This document maps the project requirements to the corresponding test cases to ensure that all requirements are tested.

3. Test Execution Log:
    - TestLog: A summary of the test execution results, including the number of test cases passed, failed, and any warnings.


## What have I done in this Test?
I have created test cases both positive & negative tests designed to validate the correct behavior of the app and identify some potential issues based on some scenarios. Basically it's divided into three sections in excel sheet (UI-UX, All input field and others mix). Test with both valid & invalid input then get 15 actual results according to the expected result. There were 5 tests got wrong and 1 was a warning. \
All images of the test cases are given below also share `excel sheet` which uploaded on **[Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A9ONZcUJ54XECvGjsVn1-jiyKj4lPWvK/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=106028938157744319674&rtpof=true&sd=true).**
